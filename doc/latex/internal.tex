Let's say your current working directory name is macsim-working

\begin{enumerate}

\item Step 1: you need to get a clean copy of macsim again. let's say you are getting a new copy in macsim-regression directory.

{\tt svn co https://svn.research.cc.gatech.edu/macsim/trunk macsim-regression --username user }

\item Step 2: you have to get a simulator tool, which is still in the hparch svn repository.

\item Step 3: go to macsim-regression/trunk/bin directory and execute regression\_gen.py which is in your tool directory.

\item Step 4: go to macsim-working/trunk/bin directory and execute regression\_test.py which is in your tool directory. 

\end{enumerate}
