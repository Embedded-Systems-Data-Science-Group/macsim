\label{sec:codetop}

This section provides a brief overview of the organization of the code in
MacSim. Code in MacSim is organized into many classes, for a descpription of
the classes please refer to the doxygen documentation.

  \ignore{
For each simulation, an instance of \textit{macsim\_c} is created.  In
\textit{macsim\_c}, there is an instance of \textit{process\_s} for each
application being simulated. An application can contain multiple threads each
represented by a \textit{thread\_s} structure. In case of GPU applications, an
instance of \textit{thread\_s} represents a warp. The threads of an application
can run on multiple cores each of which is an \textit{core\_c} object. For GPU
applications, each core represents an SM. Each core has a member variable for
each stage of the pipeline. The classes for the different pipeline stages are:
\textit{frontend\_c, allocate\_c/smc\_allocate\_c,
  schedule\_io\_c/schedule\_ooo\_c/schedule\_smc\_c, exec\_c, retire\_c}. A
  \textit{core\_c} object also contains objects of \textit{rob\_c/smc\_rob\_c}
  (ROB), \textit{cache\_c} (I-cache), \textit{readonly\_cache\_c} (Const cache
      and Texture cache), \textit{sw\_managed\_cache\_c} (Shared Memory),
  \textit{bp\_data\_c} (Branch predictor), \textit{hwp\_common\_c} (Hardware
      Prefetcher). Note that some of these components are valid for CPUs only,
  while some others are valid for GPUs only.  According to the speficied memory
  hierarchy, an instance of a class that derives from \textit{memory\_c} is
  created. This object is a member of \textit{macsim\_c} and is accessed by all
  cores in the simulation. The \textit{memory\_c} object includes objects L1,
  L2 and L3 caches and also DRAM controllers which are objects of classes that
  derive from \textit{dram\_controller\_c}.

D-cache, L2 and L3 caches and also DRAM controllers which are objects of
classes that derive from \textit{dram\_controller\_c}. 


\section{Simulator Execution}

All pipeline stages, units such as cache and memory controller, components such
as memory system and core implement the \textit{run\_a\_cycle()} function which
is called every cycle. Within the \textit{run\_a\_cycle()} function of each
component is the processing done by the component for every simulation cycle.
\textit{macsim\_c}, the simulation object, calls \textit{run\_a\_cycle()} for
the memory system, interconnect and cores in the simulation (see
    \textit{macsim.cc}). Each core in turn calls \textit{run\_a\_cycle()} for
the individual pipeline stages (see \textit{core.cc}).
